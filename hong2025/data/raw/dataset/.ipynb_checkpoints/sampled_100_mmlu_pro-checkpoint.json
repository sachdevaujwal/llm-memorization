But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n—Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nThe policy described most immediately led to",

The defendant did not object to the judge's instructions, and the judge did not give an instruction on contributory negligence. The answer is (H).\n\nQ: A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the disposal of any nuclear wastes within the state. This law does not contravene or conflict with any federal statutes. A man operates a company in the state that is engaged in the disposal of nuclear wastes. Subsequent to the passage of the state statute, the man, not yet aware of the new law, entered into contracts with many out-of-state firms to dispose of their nuclear wastes in the state. On account of this new law, however, the man will be unable to perform these contracts. Assume that the man has standing to challenge this state law. Which of the following presents his strongest constitutional grounds to challenge the state law prohibiting the disposal of nuclear wastes within the state?\nOptions are:\n",

        "solution": "1/2 is the half-life of the reaction. The half-life is equal to $t_{1/2} = \\frac{1}{k} \\cdot ln(2)$. The rate constant is $k = \\frac{1}{t_{1/2}} \\cdot ln(2)$. The rate constant is proportional to the concentration of the reactant raised to the power of n. Therefore $k \\propto [A]^{n}$. We can write $k = k_{0} \\cdot [A]^{n}$. We can then write $k_{0} = \\frac{k}{[A]^{n}}$. We can then write $k_{0} = \\frac{1}{t_{1/2}} \\cdot ln(2) \\cdot \\frac{1}{[A]^{n}}$. We can then write $k_{0} = \\frac{1}{t_{1/2}} \\cdot",
