Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Penelope, Mason, William, Mia, Jackson, Logan, and Sophia. In Penelope's words: \"Logan is a knight or Sophia is a knave\". Mason expressed that Jackson is not a knight. \"Logan is a knave if and only if William is a knight\" - William. \"Mason is not a knave\" - Mia. Jackson noted, \"William is not a knave\". As Logan put it, \"Sophia is not a knave\". As Sophia put it, \"Mia is not a knave\". So who is a knight and who is a knave?\n### Answer: Let's think step by step", "robust_metric": 0}
